## Sanity Check

**Challenge**

Welcome to InCTFi 2021!

To get the flag, please grab it from #general in our discord: https://discord.gg/CZCYZNqC4B

**Solution**

Join the Discord server and check #general description banner.

Done! We have our flag "`inctf{welcome_t0_inctf_internationals_2021}`"

## Alpha Pie

**Challenge**

We have created a mini game to test your skills. Go grab the flag!!

authors : careless_finch, malf0y

`nc misc.challenge.bi0s.in 1337`

**Solution**

First let’s look at the rules:
```
Welcome to Alpha pie game!!!
Rules:
1. To complete one level you have match the left matrix to the right one by moiving each letter to their position in the right matrix
2. Moving to only adjecent column or row is possible.
3. Diagonal movements are not possible
4. negative numbers are not allowed in the input
5. The input format should be 'current-x-cord,current-y-cord,to-x-cord,to-y-cord'.
   eg : 0,0,0,1 (Will move letter at position 0,0 to position 0,1 if a letters is present at 0,0 and no letter is present at 0,1).
7. Number of moves will be limited for each level.
8. The game has a time limit of 'n' minutes.
9. You will lose the game if you enter certain number of invalid moves
10. After you pass 9 levels you will ge the flag.
   Good luck ! Enjoy the game 👍
```

To be more exact with rule 8, the game lasts a total of `500 seconds`.


We have about 1 minute per level, which is not much, so we will create a script that will calculate for us the movements we have to make in the game.


Take, for example, Level 1:
```
Level-1
Max number of moves allowed: 5
+-------+  +-------+
| 0 | 0 |  | s | h |
| h | s |  | 0 | 0 |
+-------+  +-------+
Current moves : 0
Enter move in the format 'current-x-cord,current-y-cord,to-x-cord,to-y-cord ' :
```

s must do:
- 1,1,0,1
- 0,1,0,0

then h must do:
- 1,0,1,1
- 1,1,0,1

So we simply use an `A-Star` algorithm.

You can find my script here: [alphapie.py](./alphapie.py)

Credits to Ryan Collingwood and Nicholas Swift for their A-Star algorithm: [astar.py](https://gist.github.com/ryancollingwood/32446307e976a11a1185a5394d6657bc)

You can find my full game here: [alphapie.txt](./alphapie.txt)

Done! We have our flag "`inctf{G00d_Job_e33ac7bae54893252e60c0187e793ef5d13d7dfa85fafa7984f8753b591247b9}`"

## Tabula Recta

**Challenge**

X made a stateless password manager and used it for all the top sites he visited. But on observing the code he found that his key could retrieve a maximum number of states and decided to not use it because of its weaknesses.

However, he did not get to reset all of his passwords.

We'll send you the names of some websites at `nc 34.106.211.122 1222`. If you are able to find most of the passwords, we'll give you the flag.

**Challenge**

The quieter you become, the more you are able to listen.

Author: [f4lc0n](https://twitter.com/theevilsyn)

**Official WriteUp**

The host (172.30.0.8) will try to connect to the user's host on the ports between 31336-31338. Listen on the ports to accept the that connection and receive the flag.

## Shell Boi

**Challenge**

He sells linux shells on the shell store.

Author: [f4lc0n](https://twitter.com/theevilsyn)

**Official WriteUp**

There are 2 hosts in the network 172.30.0.5 and 172.30.0.8. Since this is a multi host environment, there are possibilities of MiTM attacks.  Perform an MiTM attack using tools like ettercap, you'll see that host A is sending IP and port details to host B, then host B sends reverse shell over that port. Now modify the IP and port to your local port and IP to get a reverse shell.

## Legacy

**Challenge**

There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, you can only see.

Author: [f4lc0n](https://twitter.com/theevilsyn)

**Official WriteUp**

There is a web server which uses legacy debug bridge api for users identified as admins. To get identified as admin, set a referer header as shown in the html page and send the debug request to the v1 api with bash commands to get RCE as www-data. 

Now, for privilege escalation - there is a cronjob running which tries lo load env variables from a file in www-data's scope and executes zcat. Create a fake zcat with reverse shell payload in the path variable set by you using the env file. Now wait for root to execute that with cron.

## Home Drive

**Challenge**

Tell us about our naive [NAS](http://172.30.0.8:5000/) architecture :P

Authors: [f4lc0n](https://twitter.com/theevilsyn), [amr_bal](https://twitter.com/amr_bal)

**Official WriteUp**

Download the apk, reverse it, understand the functionalities of the API server. Get access to the hidden FTP network by adding a manual route using ip route add and get the admin's public key. Now sign the JWT token with that key and login as admin. Now trigger the /admin/config request and send a malicious yaml for the server to load.

1. The zip file is actually deleted from disk and can be recovered by extracting the Volume shadow copy from the .E01.
2. checking the browser history tells us that the employee visited pastebin but the exact paste link is not present (Basically the employee deleted a part of the history to cover his tracks).
3. MS Windows has a feature to collect Diagnostic Data which is optional. The data collected includes MS Edge Browser History, Installed programs info and much much more.
4. To extract the DB from the system, navigate to C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Diagnosis\EventTranscript\EventTranscript.db and extract the file. Make sure to extract the -wal file too because that contains our required URL. Write Ahead Log files basically are used to maintain DB data and are written to original DB when system shuts down. That is why -wal file is important here.

5. Open the DB using any DB viewer and to view the browser history (Table - Events_presisted) and set the column filter logging_binary_name = msedge.exe.

6. In the payload section, as you dig into it, you observe the field "navigationUrl" contains the pastebin link - https://pastebin.com/cvRK3yY5

7. Navigate to the URL and supply the password obtained from the recovered deleted file - The flag is: inctf{th1s_d4y_w3_d1sc0veR3d_4_N3w_4R7iFaCt}

## The Big Score

**Challenge**

We sent Michael over to the Union Depository to collect data from one of their systems for the heist. We were able to retrieve the data, but it looks like they were able to read the message sent to us that Michael had typed from their system. Fortunately, he took the memory dump before escaping the building. Analyze the memory dump and find out how the message was compromised.

## Notepad 2 - Ken's Chronicle

Description: "Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western Europe, I was just outside of Barcelona, hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. I was at the end of this path, and I came to a clearing, and there was a lake, very secluded, and there were tall trees all around. It was dead silent. Gorgeous. And across the lake, I saw a beautiful woman bathing herself. But she was crying...". There is a rumor that the rest of the story is on this website. Help Ken Adams uncover it.
