# Hacker's Playground 2021

Hacker's Playground is a side event of SSTF(Samsung Security Tech Forum).

## Overview

I did not solve any of the challenges proposed...

The 360 points received are for successfully completing the tutorials.

Samsung has been very professional, they have set up an archive containing all the challenges as well as the writeups going with it.

So instead of rewriting everything by hand while I have no writeup to propose I propose you to go directly open the archive by yourself:
