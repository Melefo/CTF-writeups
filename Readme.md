# **CTF Writeups**

Hello! I participate in Capture The Flag events sometime because I like computer security and hacking.

A CTF consist of participants inversigating, reverse engineering, breaking and a lot of things they can think that might help to reach our end goal: a flag. A flag is generally in this format "flag{string}" that is hidden.
